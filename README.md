My motivation for creating this project was a willingness to develop my frontend skills by making more complex project than the first one.
This project was built because in future I would like to take part in beneficial activities.
By using this app, any user around the world could help people in need by sending some gifts. 
From the project I've learnt to stay humble and progress on coding. I also learnt that I am capaple of creating more complex pages using React JS library.
